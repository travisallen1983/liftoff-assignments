# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is going to offer users the ability to keep track of all their assignments(weekly assignments, papers, and tests) that are due throughout the course of a college semester. It will give the user the ability to add their classes, add their assignments for those classes, see the entirety of their schedule on the homepage, and access each individual class and set of assignments on their own individual pages. It will also allow students to remove their assignments from their schedule by either setting them to complete, and sending them to a page for completed assignments, or removing them entirely.

The project will eventually feature a calender that keeps track of other necessary social and academic events that come up during the semester.

### Features
1)login and logout of a session.
2)dynamically set and edit the semester and classes.
3)create, edit, and remove assignments.
4)display all assignments on one page, and display all assignments for a class on individual class pages.
5)allow user to decide how they wish to display there results(due date, class, type of assignment.)
6)Eventually, I would like to allow people to be able to set their own background and text themes.
### Technologies
Java
Springboot
MySQL
### What I'll Have to Learn
Most of what I'll be focusing on is expanding my understanding of Java and Thymeleaf. Some problems I'm currently looking to solve is giving people a calender instead of making them set the date in a text box, and I'm needing to expand on my understanding of relationships so that I can link and display assignments and classes properly.
